REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by Yii is that your Web server supports
PHP 5.1.0 or above. Yii has been tested with Apache HTTP server
on Windows and Linux operating systems.

Please access the following URL to check if your Web server reaches
the requirements by Yii, assuming "YiiPath" is where Yii is installed:

      http://hostname/YiiPath/requirements/index.php
